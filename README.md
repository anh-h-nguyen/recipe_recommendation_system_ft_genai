## Introduction  
This AI-powered tool creates customized recipes based on what users have available, making meal planning seamless. Instead of browsing through countless recipes online, users receive instant recommendations that match their ingredients, dietary restrictions, and time availability.  

## Features  
- Ingredient-Based Suggestions â†’ Users enter ingredients they have, and the model generates relevant recipes.  
- Dietary Customization â†’ Supports vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, keto, and more dietary preferences.  
- Time-Conscious Cooking â†’ Users specify a maximum cooking time to receive practical meal ideas.  
- Refined Prompt Engineering â†’ Ensures AI-generated recipes align closely with user inputs for accuracy.  
- Recipe Link Extraction â†’ Where possible, the system provides external links to full recipe instructions.  

## How It Works  
1. Users input their available ingredients.  
2. They select dietary preferences, if any.  
3. They define a maximum cooking time.  
4. The AI model processes the inputs and generates a structured recipe suggestion.  
5. The output includes step-by-step instructions and potential external recipe links.
